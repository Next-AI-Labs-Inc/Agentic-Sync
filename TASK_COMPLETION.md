# ⚠️ TASK COMPLETION DOCUMENTATION - READ CAREFULLY ⚠️

## CORRECT FORMAT FOR LOGGING COMPLETED TASKS

ALL task completions MUST follow these steps:

1. First, create a MongoDB task entry with status="done" following the format in ../claude.md
2. Then add an entry to THIS file in the format below (newest at top):

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] Task: Brief Title That Focuses on User Impact

**MongoDB Task ID:** task-id-here

**User Impact:** 1-2 sentences explaining how this benefits users

**Technical Summary:** 1-2 sentences describing what was implemented technically

**Verification:** Link to verification steps document or brief instruction
```

DO NOT add detailed requirements, implementation notes, or full documentation here.
Those belong in the MongoDB task entry.

## [2025-03-18] Task: Fix Next.js Build Process for Reliable Production Deployments

**MongoDB Task ID:** build-process-fix-2025-03-18

**User Impact:** Developers can now reliably build and run the production version of the application without encountering cryptic error messages, improving workflow efficiency and reducing deployment issues.

**Technical Summary:** Fixed critical TypeScript configuration issues by updating target from ES5 to ES2015, created missing build directories, and corrected port configurations in verification scripts.

**Verification:** Run `npm run build` followed by `npm run prod` to verify the application builds and runs correctly on port 3020.

## [2025-03-19] Task: Enhanced Task Item Approval System for Structured Review Workflow

**MongoDB Task ID:** task-approval-system-2025-03-19

**User Impact:** Users can now systematically review and approve individual requirements, technical plan items, and next steps, ensuring better quality control and clear accountability in the task planning process.

**Technical Summary:** Implemented a status-tracking system for task items with distinct UI states, API integration, and visual indicators showing which items are approved versus proposed, with specialized interaction patterns for each state.

**Verification:** Navigate to http://localhost:3020/tasks, expand a task, observe the approval buttons on requirement items, click "Approve" to see the item get a green border and the buttons disappear.

## [2025-03-16] Task: Prevent App Crashes with Automated Next.js Verification System 

**MongoDB Task ID:** 2025-03-16-nextjs-verification-system

**User Impact:** Users were experiencing outages when AI agents committed broken code. This system prevents broken code from being committed by verifying the app builds and starts successfully.

**Technical Summary:** Implemented pre-commit hooks that run automated verification scripts to check app building and startup, preventing broken code from entering the repository.

**Verification:** Run `npm run verify` to test the system. Try breaking the app with syntax errors and commit to see the protection working.

## Task: Optimize Task Management Application for Performance and User Experience

**Status: done**

### Task Details

**Title:** Optimize IX Tasks Application to Eliminate CPU Spikes and Improve Launch Experience

**Description:** This implementation optimizes the IX Tasks application to reduce CPU usage when running, resolve memory leaks, and provide a simpler launch experience with desktop shortcut functionality.

**User Impact:** Users were experiencing high CPU usage (100%+) when running the application, making their computers slow and requiring machine restarts. The optimizations reduce CPU consumption and make the application more responsive, while also simplifying the launch process through a single command or icon click rather than requiring separate API and frontend server launches.

**Requirements:**

- Must maintain all core task management functionality
- Must reduce CPU usage to acceptable levels
- Must not require code changes to server-side API
- Should provide a single-click launch mechanism
- Should offer an optimized minimal view with only essential features
- Must handle API requests properly with cancellation
- Must eliminate memory leaks caused by improper cleanup
- Must avoid render loops and unnecessary state updates

**Technical Plan:**

1. Add proper AbortController implementation for API request cancellation
2. Fix render loops in `TaskContext.tsx` by removing `refreshTasks` from useEffect dependencies
3. Optimize state updates by using deferred updates with setTimeout(0)
4. Create a minimal version that only loads core functionality
5. Develop a combined starter script to launch both API and frontend
6. Create a desktop shortcut generator for all platforms
7. Add production/optimized mode with disabled console logging
8. Fix the filteredTasks memoization to avoid unnecessary calculations

### Verification Steps

1. Start the optimized version with `npm run dev:optimized`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3045/minimal to access the minimal interface
3. Create, update, and delete tasks to verify functionality works
4. Open Task Manager (Windows), Activity Monitor (Mac), or top (Linux) to verify CPU usage stays below 50%
5. Create a desktop shortcut with `node scripts/create-desktop-shortcut.js`
6. Verify you can launch the application with a single click from the desktop

### Files Modified

- `/Users/jedi/react_projects/ix/tasks/src/contexts/TaskContext.tsx` - Fixed render loops and optimized state updates
- `/Users/jedi/react_projects/ix/tasks/src/services/taskApiService.ts` - Added AbortController support
- `/Users/jedi/react_projects/ix/tasks/package.json` - Added optimized and combined starter scripts
- `/Users/jedi/react_projects/ix/tasks/src/pages/_app.tsx` - Added console log suppression in production mode
- `/Users/jedi/react_projects/ix/tasks/src/pages/minimal.tsx` - Created minimal entry point
- `/Users/jedi/react_projects/ix/tasks/src/pages/tasks-core.tsx` - Created optimized task view
- `/Users/jedi/react_projects/ix/tasks/scripts/start-all.js` - Created combined starter script
- `/Users/jedi/react_projects/ix/tasks/scripts/create-desktop-shortcut.js` - Added desktop shortcut generator

### Detailed Implementation Notes

#### 1. Memory Leak & CPU Usage Fixes

**Problem:** The application was causing high CPU usage (up to 130%) due to render loops in TaskContext and inefficient API handling.

**Solution:**

- Added proper AbortController support to cancel in-flight requests when components unmount
- Fixed render loops by removing refreshTasks from useEffect dependencies
- Optimized state updates to avoid cascading renders
- Used memoization to prevent redundant calculations
- Deferred non-critical state updates with setTimeout(0)

#### 2. Launch Experience Improvements

**Problem:** Starting the application required running both the API server and frontend separately.

**Solution:**

- Created a combined starter script (start-all.js) that launches both servers
- Added a desktop shortcut creator for all major platforms
- Created an optimized mode that runs with suppressed console logs

#### 3. Minimal View Implementation

**Problem:** The application loaded unnecessary features like Initiatives and Docs that weren't needed.

**Solution:**

- Created a minimal entry point at /minimal that only loads the TaskProvider and ProjectProvider
- Implemented an optimized tasks-core page without extra features
- Added production mode flag that can be used in development

### Next Steps

1. Create a production build with automatic bundling optimization to further reduce CPU usage by eliminating dead code
2. Implement server-side rendering for faster initial load times when using the minimal view
3. Add a task board view with drag-and-drop functionality as an alternative to the list view
4. Integrate performance monitoring to track CPU/memory usage across sessions
