# Memory Optimization for Task Operations

This document describes the implementation of memory optimization for task operations in the Tasks app.

## The Memory Problem

The previous implementation created multiple full copies of the entire task list when performing optimistic updates:

```javascript
// Example from updateTaskStatus (simplified)
const updatedTask = { ...taskToUpdate, ...updateData };
const optimisticTasks = tasks.map((task) => (task.id === taskId ? updatedTask : task));
const sortedTasks = sortByNewestFirst(optimisticTasks);
setTasks(sortedTasks);
```

With hundreds of tasks, each containing substantial data (descriptions, requirements, technical plans), this created significant memory pressure because:

1. It created a complete new array of all tasks
2. It then created another copy when sorting
3. This happened for every small interaction (star, status change, approval)
4. Each change triggered React renders with these large objects

## Improved Solution

The optimized implementation:

1. Maintains the optimistic update pattern - users still get the responsive experience
2. Drastically reduces memory usage - avoids creating full copies of the task list
3. Keeps the app reactive - ensures UI updates properly when tasks change
4. Handles error states - can still revert on server errors
5. Preserves sorting order - tasks still display in the correct order

```javascript
// Optimized implementation
setTasks(prevTasks => {
  // Find the index of the task to update
  const index = prevTasks.findIndex(t => t.id === taskId);
  if (index === -1) return prevTasks;

  // Create a new array with just the one task replaced
  const newTasks = [...prevTasks];
  newTasks[index] = updatedTask;
  return newTasks;
});
```

This approach only creates a new array and replaces the specific task that changed, rather than mapping over the entire array.

## Benefits

1. Significantly reduced memory usage - especially for large task lists
2. Faster UI updates - less work for React to process changes
3. More stable performance - fewer large memory spikes
4. Same user experience - the UI still updates optimistically
5. Better error resilience - it's easier to revert individual task changes
