  "impact": "This circular dependency creates a potential initialization problem where components in the cycle may access undefined or partially initialized values. It also makes the codebase more difficult to test and refactor.",
  "suggested_fix": "Extract a shared interface or context that contains only the essential methods and properties needed by all components in the circular chain. Alternatively, consider using a unidirectional data flow approach or event-based communication to break the cycle.",
