      title: 'Implemented Modular Component Architecture for Shared Tools',
      
      description: 
        "Transformed the monolithic @ix/shared-tools package into a modular component architecture using a Lerna-based monorepo structure. This solves the 404 error when trying to install @ix/shared-tools from npm registry by using local file references instead.",
      
      userImpact:
        "Developers can now import individual components using a more intuitive and maintainable pattern (e.g., `import { Component } from '@ix/component-name'`). This eliminates confusing npm errors during installation, reduces bundle size through selective importing, and provides a clearer dependency structure for the project.",
      
      impactedFunctionality:
        "- Component import statements throughout the codebase\n- Package.json dependency management\n- Build and verification processes\n- Developer workflow for using shared components\n- Component versioning and maintenance",
      
      requirements:
        "- Must eliminate 404 errors when installing @ix/shared-tools\n- Must maintain backward compatibility during transition\n- Must provide clear migration path for developers\n- Must support automated verification of correct import patterns\n- Must reduce bundle size through selective importing\n- Must support independent versioning of components\n- Must simplify maintenance of shared components",
      
      technicalPlan:
        "1. Create monorepo structure using Lerna for shared components\n2. Develop setup-shared-components.js utility to manage dependencies\n3. Create migrate-imports.js tool to update import statements\n4. Implement verify-component-imports.js for validation\n5. Update package.json with local file references\n6. Create individual package.json files for each component\n7. Write comprehensive documentation on migration and usage\n8. Add verification steps to build process",
