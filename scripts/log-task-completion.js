      description: 
        "Fixed critical layout and interactivity problems occurring in specific filter views of the tasks UI. The issues were preventing users from interacting with task cards in 'all' and 'done' views.",
      
      userImpact:
        "Users can now seamlessly interact with tasks across all filter views, including expanding and collapsing cards, accessing edit fields, and using popovers. This eliminates the frustrating experience of tasks appearing to render but not responding to any interaction.",
      
      impactedFunctionality:
        "- Task card expansion/collapse behavior in all filter views\n- Interactive elements (buttons, form fields) within task cards\n- Popover positioning and visibility in different views\n- List rendering across filter views with different task sets",
      
      requirements:
        "- Task cards must maintain consistent interactivity across all filter views\n- Event handling must work identically regardless of filter selection\n- Interactive elements must receive focus and respond to user input\n- Visual layout must remain consistent when switching between views\n- All task card functionality must work in both regular and filtered views",
      
      technicalPlan:
        "1. Eliminate conditional virtualized rendering approach that caused positioning inconsistencies\n2. Implement consistent, non-virtualized rendering for all task lists regardless of size\n3. Fix stacking context and positioning with proper z-index management\n4. Add CSS class for expanded cards with higher z-index priority\n5. Improve event propagation handling in all interactive elements\n6. Add explicit stopPropagation to prevent unwanted event bubbling\n7. Standardize positioning approach across all filter views",
