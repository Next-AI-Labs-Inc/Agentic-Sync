# Tauri Refresh Button Issue

## Issue Description
The refresh button was added to the TaskFilters component but does not appear in the Tauri desktop build, while it works correctly in development mode.

## Status
actionable

## Requirements
- [游리] Investigate why UI changes don't appear in Tauri build
- [游리] Fix the build process to include UI updates
- [游리] Test refresh button functionality in Tauri build
- [游리] Document solution for future UI updates

## Notes
The refresh button was successfully implemented in the TaskFilters component and works in development mode, but does not appear in the production Tauri build. This is likely due to how static assets are bundled during the Tauri build process.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run the app in development mode: `npm run dev`
2. Observe the refresh button is present in the TaskFilters component
3. Build the Tauri app: `npm run tauri:build`
4. Run the built app and observe the refresh button is missing
