# Markdown Support for Tasks

## Overview

This feature adds rich text formatting capabilities to tasks using Markdown syntax, making task documentation more readable and expressive.

## Implementation

We've added full markdown support to the task system with the following changes:

1. Added `markdown` field to the MongoDB schema (DeveloperTask.js)
2. Updated API controllers to handle the markdown field
3. Created a new React component (TaskMarkdown.tsx) for rendering markdown content
4. Integrated the component into TaskCard to display markdown when a task is expanded
5. Updated type definitions to include the markdown field
6. Added testing utility pages to verify rendering

## Testing the Feature

You can test the markdown support in a few ways:

### View Existing Tasks with Markdown

A sample task with markdown content has been created with ID: `67db7e60f468f1519ca4c2c3`. 
You can view it at: http://localhost:3020/task/67db7e60f468f1519ca4c2c3

### Use the Markdown Renderer Test Page

A dedicated test page is available to verify markdown rendering:
http://localhost:3020/verify-markdown

This page shows a sample task with various markdown elements, or you can pass a task ID via the URL:
http://localhost:3020/verify-markdown?taskId=67db7e60f468f1519ca4c2c3

### Create Tasks with Markdown

When creating new tasks, you can now add markdown content:

```javascript
createTask({
  title: 'Task with markdown',
  description: 'Task description',
  markdown: '# Rich content\n\nThis is **bold** and *italic* text.',
  // ...other fields
});
```

## Markdown Capabilities

The implementation supports all standard markdown syntax:

- **Headers** (# H1, ## H2, etc.)
- **Emphasis** (*italic*, **bold**)
- **Lists** (ordered and unordered)
- **Links** ([link text](url))
- **Images** (![alt text](url))
- **Code blocks** (inline and fenced)
- **Blockquotes** (> quoted text)
- **Tables** (| column | column |)

## Future Enhancements

Possible future enhancements include:

1. Adding markdown support to other text fields (description, requirements, etc.)
2. Supporting syntax highlighting for code blocks
3. Adding a toolbar for common markdown formatting
4. Implementing HTML sanitization for security
