## Implementation Status

### Next.js Routing Fix - Phase 1 Complete

The first phase of the routing fix has been implemented:

1. ✅ Updated navigation in `tasks.tsx` to use Next.js Router instead of direct browser navigation
2. ✅ Created compatibility redirect in `task-detail.tsx` for legacy URLs
3. ✅ Added server-side rendering for task detail page
4. ✅ Removed localStorage caching mechanism

The changes have addressed the most critical issues with the routing implementation:
- Eliminated full page reloads when navigating to task details
- Implemented proper SSR for better performance and SEO
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing links and bookmarks
- Reduced code complexity by removing custom caching

### Next Steps

Phase 2 and 3 of the implementation plan should be completed next:

1. Implement SWR for client-side data fetching
2. Add optimistic UI updates
3. Implement prefetching for common navigation paths
4. Clean up and standardize remaining URL patterns

## Testing

To test the current implementation:

1. Navigate to the tasks list page
2. Click on a task to view its details (should be a smooth transition with no full page reload)
3. Use the back button to return to the tasks list (state should be preserved)
4. Try accessing a task via `/task-detail?id=123` (should redirect to `/task/123`)

The implementation maintains backward compatibility while providing a better user experience.
