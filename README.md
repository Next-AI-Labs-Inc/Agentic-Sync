## Recent Enhancements

This project has been enhanced with:

### Initiatives View Enhancements (March 2025)

The Initiatives view has been significantly improved with the following features:

- **MongoDB Integration**: Initiatives are now stored in MongoDB for persistent, reliable storage
- **Modern UI Elements**: 
  - Always-visible action buttons (no more hover to reveal)
  - Proper display of initiative descriptions
  - Improved card layout with expandable details
  - Visual feedback for status changes
- **Advanced Sorting and Filtering**:
  - Sort by creation date, update date, priority, or status
  - Filter by initiative status (planning, in-progress, etc.)
  - Controls for ascending/descending sort order
- **Optimistic UI Updates**: Changes to initiatives appear immediately before server confirmation
- **Improved Loading Experience**: Eliminated UI flickering during data loading

#### Setting Up Initiatives MongoDB Integration

A migration script has been created to move initiative data from JSON files to MongoDB:

```bash
# Install required dependencies
npm install

# Run the migration script
npm run migrate-initiatives

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

This migration safely deduplicates initiatives to prevent data inconsistencies, similar to the task deduplication system.

## Documentation

Complete documentation is available in the application under the Docs tab. Key documentation includes:

- [Enhanced UI Guide](./docs/ENHANCED_UI_GUIDE.md): Details of the instant UI updates and animations
- Comprehensive guides for using Tasks, Initiatives, and KPIs

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

## Technical Details

- **Stack**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API
