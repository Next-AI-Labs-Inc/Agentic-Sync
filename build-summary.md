## Build Instructions

### Simple build (recommended)
1. **Run the automatic build script**
   ```bash
   npm run build:app
   ```
   This script will:
   - Install all dependencies
   - Generate the IX icons
   - Build the Next.js static assets
   - Build the Tauri desktop app
   - Display the location of the built app

### Manual build steps
1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Generate icons**
   ```bash
   npm run generate-icons
   ```

3. **Build Next.js static site**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Build the desktop app**
   ```bash
   npm run tauri:build
   ```

5. **Find built app at**
   - macOS: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/IX Agent Sync_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg`
   - Windows: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/IX Agent Sync_0.1.0_x64_en-US.msi`
   - Linux: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/appimage/ix-agent-sync_0.1.0_amd64.AppImage`

## Authentication

The app uses the password `ixAgent2025!SyncData` for authentication. When the "Remember me" checkbox is selected, the app will automatically log in on subsequent launches without requiring password entry.

## Removed Features

1. **Initiatives** - Completely removed as it was deprecated
2. **Docs in Tauri** - Removed from navigation as it doesn't work in Tauri app

## Notes

- For the web version, you can still run `npm run dev` to start the development server
- The desktop app is a self-contained build with all assets and doesn't need external services
- Password authentication happens locally within the app itself
- The "Remember me" feature stores credentials in localStorage so the app will auto-login next time it's opened
